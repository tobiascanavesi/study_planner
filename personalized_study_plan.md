Based on the available time slots on Wednesday from 10-15 and Friday from 10-13 for the next 4 weeks, I have created a personalized study schedule for optimal learning:

Week 1:
- Wednesday 10-15: Focus on Chapter 1 - Introduction to Mathematical Economics (3 hours)
- Friday 10-13: Review Chapter 1 and practice problem-solving (3 hours)

Week 2:
- Wednesday 10-15: Dive into Chapter 2 - Equilibrium Analysis (3 hours)
- Friday 10-13: Review Chapter 2 and work on problem sets (3 hours)

Week 3:
- Wednesday 10-15: Study Chapter 3 - Optimization (3 hours)
- Friday 10-13: Review Chapter 3, practice problem-solving, and revisit key concepts (3 hours)

Week 4:
- Wednesday 10-15: Cover Chapter 4 - Comparative Statics (3 hours)
- Friday 10-13: Review Chapter 4, focus on difficult topics, and engage in problem-solving exercises (3 hours)

This structured study schedule ensures a balanced approach to learning, with dedicated time for studying key topics, reviewing previously covered material, and practicing problem-solving skills. By following this plan, you will be able to optimize your study sessions and make the most of the available time slots.

To estimate the number of pages to study for each session, it would be beneficial to break down the chapters and topics into manageable sections. Each chapter includes multiple topics, concepts, and exercises, so estimating the time needed to study each topic would involve considering the complexity and depth of understanding required for each. Additionally, reviewing the examples and exercises provided in the text can help gauge the level of difficulty and time needed to comprehend the material. Creating a study schedule based on the topics covered in each chapter and allocating time slots for studying specific sections can optimize study efficiency and time management.
