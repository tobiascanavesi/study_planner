Based on the specific topics that need to be studied, such as Single Variable Functions, Non-linear Functions, Differentiable Functions, Simple Linear Models in Economics, and Multivariate Functions, a detailed study schedule can be created. However, the estimated number of pages for each topic is still pending, as additional resources are needed to gather the necessary data. To optimize the learning experience and make the most of the available time slots on Wednesday 10-15 and Friday 10-13 during 6 weeks, it is essential to finalize the estimation of pages for each topic and incorporate it into the study schedule for efficient time management and effective learning outcomes.
