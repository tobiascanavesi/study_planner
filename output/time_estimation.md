- Non-linear Functions: 3-4 hours
- Differentiable Functions: 4-5 hours
- Simple Linear Models in Economics: 2-3 hours
- Multivariate Functions: 3-4 hours

To optimize study time within the available time slots of Wednesday 10-15 and Friday 10-13 during 8 weeks, it is recommended to create a study schedule that allocates specific time slots for each topic based on the estimated study times provided. It is crucial to prioritize topics based on their complexity and allocate more time to topics that require deeper understanding. Additionally, incorporating breaks and review sessions into the study schedule can help maintain focus and retention of information. By following a structured study plan and utilizing study techniques such as active learning and spaced repetition, students can make the most of their study time and achieve effective learning outcomes.
