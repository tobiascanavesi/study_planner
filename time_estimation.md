Based on the information gathered by the Study Planner, I can estimate the study time needed for each topic and suggest optimizing study time as follows:

1. Topic A: Estimated study time - 6 hours
2. Topic B: Estimated study time - 4 hours
3. Topic C: Estimated study time - 5 hours
4. Topic D: Estimated study time - 3 hours

To optimize study time, I recommend creating a study schedule that incorporates shorter study sessions spread throughout the available time slots on Wednesday (10-15) and Friday (10-13) over the 4-week period. This will allow for better retention of information and prevent burnout. Additionally, breaking down the study material into smaller, manageable chunks and utilizing active study techniques such as summarizing, self-testing, and spaced repetition can further enhance learning efficiency.
