A First Course in Mathematical Economics

By Sunanda Roy

This book provides a bridge from college math courses to intermediate economics, focusing on mathematical techniques useful for formalizing and presenting economic ideas. It emphasizes intuitive understanding of these techniques and their application in economic analysis. The book covers topics such as single variable functions, differentiable functions, linear models in economics, non-linear functions, optimization, multivariate functions, and constrained optimization.

The estimated number of pages in the analysis is not specified in the text. The content of the book includes preface, chapters on various mathematical economics topics, acknowledgments, and end of chapter questions. The book aims to help undergraduate economics majors transition to calculus-based intermediate economics courses. It emphasizes the importance of mathematical tools in economic analysis and provides practical examples and exercises for students to apply the concepts learned.

The chapters cover fundamental concepts of sets, functions, domain and range, function evaluation, and graphing functions. The book highlights the role of parameters in function expressions and their impact on graphical representations. It also introduces the concept of function composition, where two functions are combined to map elements of one set to another.

Overall, the book serves as a valuable resource for students aiming to enhance their mathematical understanding of economic principles and their application in real-world scenarios.
